# waterrocket
Waterrocket contains supplementary files to our high school thesis.
* [waterrocket.ipynb](https://github.com/eckp/waterrocket/blob/master/waterrocket.ipynb) provides a numerical solution and optimization of ballistic trajectories with drag
* [datalogger_V1.py](https://github.com/eckp/waterrocket/blob/master/datalogger_V1.py) is a micropython programm used to log the acceleration during the flight
* [parabolicnose.ggb](https://github.com/eckp/waterrocket/blob/master/parabolicnose.ggb) Geogebra model of a parabolic nosecone. To view it, download the file by clicking 'View Raw', then open it either in Geogebra or [online](https://www.geogebra.org/graphing)
* [waterrocket.ggb](https://github.com/eckp/waterrocket/blob/master/waterrocket.ggb) Geogebra model of the ballistic trajectory of a rocket (Geogebra version of [waterrocket.ipynb](https://github.com/eckp/waterrocket/blob/master/waterrocket.ipynb)).
